# Chinese Remainder Theorem
we are given k numbers which are pairwise coprime, and given remainders of these numbers when an unknown number x is divided by them. We need to find the minimum possible value of x that produces given remainders.

## sample input/output:
Enter size of array:3 <br />
Enter value of coprime numbers:3 <br />
4 <br />
5 <br />
Enter value of remainders:2 <br />
3 <br />
1 <br />
Minimum number found is 11 <br />

## Relevance in Cryptography:
CRT based secured encryption scheme is fast and easy to implement. <br />
Below is the link of a paper published by IEEE explaining how CRT is a good alternate encryption system to deal with multiple secrets and users. <br />
